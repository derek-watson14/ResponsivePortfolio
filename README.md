## Responsive Portfolio

This repository hosts my attempt at the third homework assignment of the UW Coding Bootcamp -
using Bootstrap to create a "portfolio site" to certain specifications given to us. I had a lot
of fun learning Bootstrap and can tell once I have it down it will be very easy to quickly create
nice and consistent looking websites.

I wanted to use custom colors on my site, and decided to employ CSS variables to make them consistent
across pages and easy to manage (only change in one place).

One project requiremnt I had trouble with was minimizing media queries. To achieve the design I
wanted I found myself reaching for them to adjust the margin and padding in both the navbar and around
the cards on the pages as the screen is resized.

Additionally I am not certian if I used grid properly or not, perhaps that would have helped to solve my
first problem.
